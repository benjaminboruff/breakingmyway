## From Scrambling to Breaking Away

Sometime during the mid-70s, I received a Schwinn Scrambler as a Christmas or birthday gift. I can't remember which, but I remember really wanting that bike.

It was silver-gray with matt black "moto-X-ape-hanger" style handlebars and a banana seat. Man, what a machine.

When I got it, I didn't even know how to ride a bike. I was a bit of a late bloomer with respect to riding bicycles. So, for whatever reason, when I finally got the bike of my childhood-dreams, I couldn't even ride it.

That was around the same time my parents got divorced. I'm sure that had something to do with my delayed start at cycling. As a matter of fact, I finally learned right as I was getting too big for the Scrambler.

Breaking Away was filmed in Bloomington, IN (my hometown) in 1978, and released in 1979, winning an Oscar for "Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen" by Steve Tesich. My mom and cousin were extras in the film. 

As a matter of fact, my mom walks in front of the camera in the bowling alley - she is wearing a green "Dyer Dragons" t-shirt and has long, straight, dark hair - right before the fight scene in the Union.

This film fundamentally changed Bloomington, IN. Sure, IU had great sports teams. IU Men's Basketball, under Bob Knight, went undefeated in 1976. As of this writing, they are still the last NCAA team to do so.

I believe these two events changed Bloomington from an aging, mid-sized, mid-western town into a revitalized, growing city. The downtown area wasn't in the best shape prior to Breaking Away. 

All that changed in the 80s and 90s.
